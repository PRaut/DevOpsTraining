                    The objective of Shivaji Maharaj in founding Swaraj is clearly expressed in his official seal of that time. The following Sanskrit Lines are inscribed in it:
                </p>
                <p id="mainpara">
                   'प्रतिपच्चंद्रलेखेव <br/> वर्धिष्णुर्विश्ववंदिता <br/>शाहसुनोः शिवस्यैषा मुद्रा भद्राय राजते।'
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through his mudra, Shivaji Maharaj has assured his people that 'Ever-Increasing Like The Crescent Moon, The Kingdom Of Shivaji, The Son Of Shahaji, will always seek the welfare of the people.'
